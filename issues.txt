1. (might have fixed this by always setting audio = true) Audio cannot be heard from screensharer
2. (fixed by taking out) Display Names are duplicated 
3. (FIXED) Clear the message from the chat log --> causes confusion over whether msg sent
4. (FIXED) Make the input hints more contrasted â€”> but still have it be gray
5. (FIXED) auto scroll chat!!!
6. (FIXED) Screen share sometimes not working correctly when leaving and entering room again
