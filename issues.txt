1. (might have fixed this by always setting audio = true) Audio cannot be heard from screensharer
2. Display Names are duplicated 
3. (FIXED) Clear the message from the chat log --> causes confusion over whether msg sent
4. (FIXED) Make the input hints more contrasted â€”> but still have it be gray
5. (FIXED) auto scroll chat!!!

Pros: 
- Green color is nice on the eyes
-
