# AgoraVideoApp
Video conferencing web app using Agora.io and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services API

## November 03, 2020
- Potentially changing name to "Anonymous Cafe"? 
  - Each video + message room would be called a "cafe"
- Live draft on this private repo: https://github.com/JetPlaneJJ/ReDesigned_AgoraVideoApp
- Known issue: sometimes people joining the cafe won't be able to see other people's video when they join (> 1 total members in 1 cafe)

## October 18, 2020
- Re-design of entire appearance (WIP!) See Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/amuBiLcFHhx5M0VVExFnf9/Mystery-Video-App?node-id=0%3A1
- Checking for accessibility/screen reader tabbing
